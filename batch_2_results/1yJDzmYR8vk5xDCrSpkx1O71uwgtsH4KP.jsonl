{"role": "User", "content": "Hey, I've got this snippet that uses the `random` module to generate a list of 5 random integers between 1 and 10. Can you modify it to use `randint` instead of `choice`? Here's the code: `import random\nnumbers = [random.choice(range(1, 11)) for _ in range(5)]`", "type": "markdown"}
{"role": "Assistant", "content": "Sure! The `randint(a,b)` function from the `random` module generates a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Here is how you can modify your list comprehension to use `randint` instead of `choice`:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nnumbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(5)]\n```\n\nEach iteration of the list comprehension will now call `random.randint(1, 10)` to generate a random integer between 1 and 10, inclusive. The underscore `_` is commonly used as a throwaway variable in Python to indicate that its value is not used.", "type": "markdown"}
