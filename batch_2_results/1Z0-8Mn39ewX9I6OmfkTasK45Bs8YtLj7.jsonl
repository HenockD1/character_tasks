{"role": "User", "content": "1.   httpx supports asynchronous requests which allows you to write more efficient I/O-bound operations by enabling other tasks to run while waiting for responses from external services. This is particularly useful in web scraping, API calls, and other network-bound tasks.\n2. With httpx, you can perform multiple HTTP requests concurrently in a single event loop\n\n3. httpx supports HTTP/2, which provides improved performance for requests to servers that support this protocol.", "type": "markdown"}
