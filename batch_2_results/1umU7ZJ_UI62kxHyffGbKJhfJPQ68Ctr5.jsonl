{"role": "Assistant", "content": "Here's a concise guide to tuning the hyperparameters of a Random Forest model:\n\n1. Figure out which parameters you want to tune, like the number of trees (`n_estimators`), max depth (`max_depth`), etc.\n\n2. Define a range of values for each hyperparameter you want to explore.\n\n3. Employ `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn to search through different combinations of hyperparameters.\n\n4. After the search, grab the combination that gives the best performance.\n\n5. Train your Random Forest model using the identified best hyperparameters on the entire dataset.\n\nExample:", "type": "markdown"}

{"role": "Assistant", "content": "Choosing the right number of folds for cross-validation depends on your dataset size and the computational resources you have:\n\n- Small to medium datasets: 5 to 10 folds are solid.\n- Large datasets: You can get away with 3 to 5 folds.", "type": "markdown"}
