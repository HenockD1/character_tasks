    "I'm working on a graph problem and here's my DFS code. I realized I need to include a counter for the number of connected components. Could you tweak my code to do that? Here's what I have so far: ```def dfs(graph): visited = set() def explore(node): if node not in visited: visited.add(node) for neighbour in graph[node]: explore(neighbour) for node in graph: explore(node)``` How should I modify it to count and return the number of connected components?\n"
